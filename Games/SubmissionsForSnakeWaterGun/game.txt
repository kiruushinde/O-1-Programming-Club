if computer chose gun and you also gave input as gun then match will be draw.
in same way, if computer chose snake and you chose gun then you will won the match.
and find out all the cases..

for this you will need to specify the computers input..

34 to 66 --> computer choose g
67 to 100 --> computer choose w




me and computer...
