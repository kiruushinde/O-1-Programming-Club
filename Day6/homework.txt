#️⃣ Homework 

1. on switch case 😎

    if I enter an age, then following should be printed on screen.

    // 8 --> your age is between 1 to 10
    // 18 --> your age is between 11 to 20
    // 28 --> your age is between 21 to 30
    // 38 --> your age is between 31 to 40
    // 48 --> your age is between 41 to 50

2. learn XOR operator with example 

3. increment and decrement 

    a = 10;

    --a;
    ++a;
    a--;
    a++;
    a--;

    what is the value of a ? 🙄
